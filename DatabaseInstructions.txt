Database Instructions

Download MySQL on your Computer
Keep note of your username and password

Run these commands (I ran them from my terminal)
CREATE DATABASE GradGoalsApp;
USE GradGoalsApp;
CREATE TABLE Users ( 
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, 
username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE, 
password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO Users (username, password) VALUES ('admin', '1234');

Download whatever MySQL tools you need on VS Code (they come up automatically)
Download the MySQL connector and add the .jar file to a folder within the overall project folder
Then, in the GradGoalsLoginSystem Java File, change lines 29 and 30 to include your own password

Finally, run the java file. For the username "admin" and password "1234" it should work with the database
